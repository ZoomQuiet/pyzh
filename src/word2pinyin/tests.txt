HanZi to Pinyin 
=======================
This module is used to convert Hanzi to pinyin. It is very esay to use.

First, we should import the module:

        >>> from pinyin import hanzi2pinyin

Remember, the input text should be in unicode format, and the output is unicode too.

We test pure Chinese text:

	>>> hanzi2pinyin('公共的模'.decode('utf8'))
	u'gonggongdemo'

If it is a English string, it keep the same:

	>>> hanzi2pinyin(u'This is an English sentence')
	u'This is an English sentence'

Mixtured text works too:

	>>> hanzi2pinyin('公共的  模 abc'.decode('utf8'))
	u'gonggongde  mo abc'
